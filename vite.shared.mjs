 * original — status 200, right content type, nothing to notice except that the
 * map is a blurry mess. OBS sends a Referer, browsers here did not, and the
 * same URL therefore looked fine in testing and wrong on the streaming machine.
 *
 * `no-referrer` does fix it, and is set as well, but a backdrop the whole
 * tracker is read against should not depend on a third party's hotlink policy
 * staying the way it is today.

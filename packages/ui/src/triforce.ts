/**
 * The Triforce panel.
 *
 * Replaces nine stacked dungeon rows with the shape the game itself uses: one
 * triangle subdivided into eight numbered sub-triangles, one per level. The
 * rows cost 318px of height to carry eight booleans and never showed the
 * spatial relationship between them; this costs about 130px and does.
 *
 * Geometry is taken from the randomizer wiki's Triforce map. Two things about
 * it are worth knowing:
 *
 *  - The triangle is right-isoceles (height = half the base), not equilateral,
 *    so the viewBox is 100x50. An equilateral 100x88 would distort it.
 *  - **Which level sits in which sub-triangle depends on the quest.** The wiki
 *    publishes four diagrams, one per quest combination. Levels 1-6 always
 *    occupy the same six positions and 7-8 the same two, so a Mixed split is
 *    always well defined — but 2nd Quest permutes the numbering within each
 *    group. Getting this from `questForLevel` is what makes the Quest split
 *    control visibly do something.

 * The centroid is the average of the vertices, which for a right triangle sits
 * closer to the hypotenuse than to the legs — so a numeral centred there leans
 * into the long edge. The visible digit stayed inside, but its em box crossed
 * an edge on seven of the eight wedges, and the digit read as pushed into the
 * corner rather than placed in the middle.

 * The incenter is the centre of the inscribed circle: the point furthest from
 * all three edges at once, which is what "centred in a triangle" should mean
 * when you are fitting something into it. All eight wedges are congruent, so
 * each shifts by the same 1.43 units; measured clearance goes from 5.9 to 7.12

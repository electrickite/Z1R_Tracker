# Sprites

## How resolution works

`packages/core/src/sprites/manifest.json` maps a **logical key** to an entry:

```json
"item.sword.wood": { "url": "https://example.com/sword.png", "name": "Wooden Sword", "glyph": "SW" }
```

Renderers never see a URL. They call `resolver.resolve('item.sword.wood')` and get one of four
things back, in this precedence order:

| Result | When | Rendered as |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sheet` | `sheet` + `rect` are set | the sheet, offset to the region |
| `image` | `url` is set | `background-image`, pixelated |
| `svg` | the key has a built-in vector | inline SVG drawn from `vectors.ts` |
| `glyph` | none of the above | the `glyph` letters in a dashed box |

Supplied art deliberately outranks the built-in vectors, so dropping in a CSV of real NES sprites
overrides them without touching code.

### The vector tier

Some sprites are simple enough to draw: a Triforce piece is three triangles, a rupee is a hexagon,
an overworld shop is a hut. Those live in `packages/core/src/sprites/vectors.ts` as inline SVG.

It costs a few hundred bytes each and buys a lot — no third-party host to go down, no CORS or
hotlink question, works offline, no attribution burden, and the tracker looks finished the moment
you clone it. Items with real detail were never going to be drawn by hand — a hand-drawn
approximation of a recognisable sprite looks worse than honest letters — so those are the ones the
manifest points at real art for.

Overworld marks are drawn as **distinct silhouettes**, not coloured squares. That is deliberate —
see the accessibility rule in [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

An image that fails to load — dead host, hotlink blocking, offline — **downgrades to its glyph** at
runtime rather than leaving an empty cell. That is the single most important property of this layer:
a tracker that quietly loses half its icons mid-run is worse than one showing letters.

## What the shipped manifest points at

**36 of 45 keys render as art**: 23 from URLs — 22 items plus the overworld hint-map reference image
— and 13 as drawn vectors. The nine that don't are `dungeon.1` … `dungeon.9`.

The item art — 22 keys, every sword, bow, arrow, boomerang, candle, ring, potion and quest item —
are individual transparent GIFs, one per item, at true NES resolution. Typical size is 16x32
portrait, with outliers from 6px to 32px wide. Because they're original-resolution rather than
pre-scaled, nearest-neighbour upscaling matters — a smoothed sprite at 40px looks obviously wrong
next to a game capture, which is why the image tier renders `image-rendering: pixelated` rather
than leaving it to the browser default.

### Why the level numerals stay as glyphs

`dungeon.1` through `dungeon.9` have no art and don't need any. The site has no per-level numeral
sprites to point at, and a numeral is a glyph in the first place — a boxed `7` reads exactly as well
as a picture of one, at any size, offline, with no host involved. This isn't an outstanding task.

## Filling in the manifest

### From a CSV

```bash
npm run sprites:import -- sprites.csv
```

Header row required. Recognised columns, case-insensitive:

| Column | Aliases | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `url` | `link`, `src`, `href` | yes | Absolute, or relative to `baseUrl` |
| `key` | `id`, `sprite` | one of | The manifest key — unambiguous, prefer this |
| `name` | `label` | one of | Matched against existing entry names, case-insensitive |
| `glyph` | `fallback` | no | 1–3 character fallback |

Rows are **merged**, not replaced. Importing a partial sheet leaves everything else alone, so you
can fill the manifest in over several passes. A key the manifest doesn't know yet is added rather
than dropped.

See [`sprites.example.csv`](sprites.example.csv) for the shape.

### By hand

Edit `manifest.json` directly. Set `baseUrl` if all your art lives under one host and you'd rather
store short paths:

```json
{ "baseUrl": "https://cdn.example.com/z1r", "sprites": { "item.bow": { "url": "bow.png" } } }
```

Absolute URLs and `data:` URIs ignore `baseUrl`.

### From a sprite sheet

One remote file, many keys:

```json
"item.bow": { "name": "Bow", "sheet": "https://example.com/items.png", "rect": [16, 0, 16, 16] }
```

`rect` is `[x, y, width, height]` in sheet pixels.

## Checking coverage

```bash
npm run sprites:check
```

Lists every key still falling back to a glyph — currently the nine level numerals, by choice. Add
`-- --fetch` to HEAD each URL and flag dead links; that form exits non-zero on a dead link, so it's
safe to wire into CI, and it's the cheap way to notice that videogamesprites.net has moved or
started blocking. Unfilled keys never fail the check — a glyph is a valid state, not a build error.

## Overriding at runtime

Every build ships a copy of the manifest as `sprites.json` beside its own `index.html`, and fetches
that at startup before falling back to the copy compiled into the bundle. Editing the deployed
`sprites.json` re-skins the tracker with no rebuild — useful for trying an art pack on a live
overlay mid-stream.

The file is emitted at build time from `packages/core/src/sprites/manifest.json`, so there is still
only one copy in the repository. Don't commit per-app copies; they'd drift.

The `file://` desktop build skips the fetch, since local pages can't read sibling files, and uses
its bundled copy.

## Choosing a host

Whatever you point at has to allow hotlinking. Hosts that block it will silently serve a placeholder
or a 403, and the tracker will show glyphs instead. Check with a third-party referer, not just by
pasting the URL into a browser bar — plenty of hosts only object when there's a referer to object
to.

CORS headers are *not* required. Nothing here reads pixels back, so the loader asks for images
without `crossOrigin`, and demanding a header the host doesn't send would only cost you working art.
The trade is that such images can't be read from a canvas — see above.

If you control the art, a GitHub Pages branch or any static CDN is the least fragile option, and
sidesteps both questions.

## Key naming

Dot-separated, most general first:

```
item.<item>[.<tier>]     item.sword.magical, item.bow
dungeon.<level>          dungeon.1 … dungeon.9
mark.<kind>              mark.shop, mark.bombable
ui.<element>             ui.triforce
```

Keys are referenced from `items.ts`, `dungeons.ts` and `overworld.ts`. Renaming one means updating
both the manifest and the definition that points at it.
